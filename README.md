About The Project


This Android application demonstrates real-time object detection using a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model within a Jetpack Compose UI. The app utilizes CameraX to capture images, processes them with a pre-trained TFLite model, and displays detected objects in real-time.

Features
Real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite
Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose
Camera input handled by CameraX
Display detected objects with bounding boxes and labels

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Android Studio: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.
TFLite Model: Download a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite object detection model (e.g., detect.tflite).
Installation
Clone the repo
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tflite-object-detection-compose.git
Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync the project with Gradle by clicking Sync Now in the prompt that appears.
Place the TFLite model file (detect.tflite) in the src/main/assets directory.
Add the necessary permissions for camera and file access in AndroidManifest.xml:
xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
