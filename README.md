TFLite Object Detection Model App with Jetpack Compose
Introduction
This Android application demonstrates how to use a TensorFlow Lite object detection model within a Jetpack Compose UI. The app uses CameraX to capture images, processes them with a pre-trained TFLite model, and displays detected objects in real-time.

Features
Real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite
Modern UI built with Jetpack Compose
Camera input handled by CameraX
Display detected objects with bounding boxes and labels
Requirements
Android Studio Bumblebee or later
Android device with CameraX support
Minimum SDK level 24
Getting Started
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tflite-object-detection-compose.git
cd tflite-object-detection-compose
Setup the Project
Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync the project with Gradle by clicking Sync Now in the prompt that appears.
Add TFLite Model
Download the pre-trained TensorFlow Lite object detection model (e.g., detect.tflite).
Place the model file in the src/main/assets directory.
Update the AndroidManifest.xml
Ensure you have the necessary permissions for camera and file access:

xml
Copy code
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
Project Structure
MainActivity.kt: The main activity that initializes the Compose UI.
CameraPreview.kt: Composable function to display the camera preview using CameraX.
ObjectDetectionImageAnalyser.kt: Handles the TensorFlow Lite model inference.
ModelUtils.kt: Utility functions for loading the TFLite model and processing the results.
ui.theme/: Contains theme and styling for Jetpack Compose.
Implementation Details
CameraX Setup
The CameraX setup is handled in CameraView.kt, which uses a PreviewView to display the camera feed. The image analysis is done in real-time by binding the camera use case to an analyzer.

TensorFlow Lite Model Inference
The model inference logic is in ObjectDetectionProcessor.kt, where the input image from the camera is processed by the TFLite model to detect objects. The detected objects are then drawn on the camera preview.

Jetpack Compose UI
The Compose UI elements are defined in MainActivity.kt and CameraView.kt. The UI updates in real-time to show bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

Running the App
Connect your Android device or use an emulator (device with CameraX support recommended).
Run the app from Android Studio by clicking Run or pressing Shift + F10.
